# GolosWeb3

A decentralized voting application built on Ethereum using React, Wagmi, and a Solidity smart contract. This project demonstrates a secure, transparent, and user-friendly voting system deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with features like candidate registration, voter management, and blind signature-based anonymity.

# Overview
GolosWeb3 is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to facilitate secure and transparent voting on the Ethereum blockchain. The application leverages a Solidity smart contract to manage voting logic, ensuring immutability and trustlessness. The frontend, built with React and Wagmi, provides an intuitive interface for users to connect their MetaMask wallet, vote, and manage candidates (for admins). The system incorporates blind signature protocols for voter anonymity and is deployed on the Sepolia testnet for safe experimentation.
This project was developed as part of a diploma thesis, showcasing expertise in blockchain development, frontend engineering, and secure system design.
